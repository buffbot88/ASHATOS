# Language Model Processor Module - RaOS v5.0

## Overview
The Language Model Processor is a new core module introduced in RaOS v5.0 that automatically detects, validates, and processes .gguf language model files during the boot sequence. It includes intelligent self-healing capabilities to recover from corrupted or failed model loads.

## Features

### Automatic Model Detection
- Scans the `llama.cpp/models` directory for .gguf files during boot
- Creates the models directory if it doesn't exist
- Logs all discovered models with size information

### Model Validation
- Verifies GGUF file format by checking the magic number (first 4 bytes should be "GGUF")
- Calculates SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
- Detects corrupted, inaccessible, or invalid model files
- Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Self-Healing Capabilities
- Automatically attempts to heal failed models after initial processing
- Supports up to 3 healing attempts per model
- Handles different failure types:
  - **FileNotFound**: Model file is missing
  - **CorruptFile**: Invalid GGUF format or corrupted data
  - **ProcessingError**: Unexpected errors during processing
- Retries validation and processing for recoverable failures
- Logs all healing attempts with success/failure status

### Boot Sequence Integration
- Runs as Step 1.5 in the RaOS boot sequence (after health checks, before web server verification)
- Non-blocking: Boot continues even if model processing fails
- Displays status summary during boot
- Updates version display to "Ra OS v5.0"

## Usage

### Available Commands
The module supports the following commands via the module interface:

#### `status`
Displays current status of loaded and failed models:
```
LanguageModelProcessor Status:
  Models Directory: llama.cpp/models
  Loaded Models: 2
  Failed Models: 1

Loaded Models:
  ✓ model1.gguf (150.50 MB)
  ✓ model2.gguf (75.25 MB)

Failed Models:
  ✗ corrupted.gguf - Invalid GGUF magic number - file may be corrupted
```

#### `scan`
Manually triggers model scanning and loading:
```
[Module:LanguageModelProcessor] INFO: Manual scan requested...
[Module:LanguageModelProcessor] INFO: Starting Language Model Processor for RaOS v5.0...
...
```

#### `heal`
Attempts to heal all failed models:
```
[Module:LanguageModelProcessor] INFO: Manual healing requested...
[Module:LanguageModelProcessor] INFO: Attempting to heal model: corrupted.gguf
...
```

#### `report`
Generates a detailed report with full model information:
```
=== Language Model Processor Report ===

Status: Initialized
Models Directory: llama.cpp/models
Total Models Found: 3
Successfully Loaded: 2
Failed: 1

=== Successfully Loaded Models ===

```

## Boot Sequence Flow

1. **Step 1/4**: Health Check (Self-Healing Module)
2. **Step 1.5/4**: .gguf Processing (Language Model Processor) ← NEW
3. **Step 2/4**: Nginx Check (Web Server Configuration)
4. **Step 3/4**: PHP Check (PHP Configuration)
5. **Step 4/4**: Boot Complete

## Model File Requirements

### Valid .gguf File Format
- Must start with "GGUF" magic number (bytes 0-3)
- Must be readable by the system
- Should be placed in the `llama.cpp/models` directory

### Example Directory Structure
```
llama.cpp/
  └── models/
      ├── llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
      ├── mistral-7b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
      └── codellama-13b.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## Logging

The module provides comprehensive logging at different levels:

### INFO Level
- Model discovery and scanning results
- Successful model processing
- Healing attempts and successes
- Status updates

### WARN Level
- Missing model directory
- Failed healing attempts
- Models that reached maximum healing attempts

### ERROR Level
- Model validation failures
- Corrupted files detected
- Processing errors
- General exceptions

## Error Handling

The module is designed to be non-blocking and fail-safe:
- Always continues boot sequence, even with errors
- Logs all failures with detailed information
- Attempts automatic recovery where possible
- Provides clear error messages for manual intervention

## Technical Details

### Model Validation Process
1. Check file existence
2. Verify file is readable
3. Read first 4 bytes and verify GGUF magic number
4. Calculate SHA256 checksum (first 1MB for performance)
5. Record model information or failure details

### Self-Healing Process
1. Identify failed models after initial scan
2. For each failure (up to 3 attempts):
   - **FileNotFound**: Log as non-recoverable
   - **CorruptFile**: Retry validation (file might have been in use)
   - **ProcessingError**: Retry complete processing
3. Log healing results
4. Remove successfully healed models from failure list

### Performance Considerations
- Checksums are calculated on first 1MB only to speed up boot
- Model scanning is optimized for large directories
- Self-healing has a maximum attempt limit to prevent infinite loops
- All operations are asynchronous where possible

## Integration with Other Modules

The Language Model Processor integrates seamlessly with:
- **AILanguageModule**: Can access discovered models
- **SelfHealingModule**: Uses similar recovery patterns
- **MemoryModule**: Could store model metadata (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- Model download and auto-update capabilities
- Integration with model repositories (HuggingFace, etc.)
- Model performance benchmarking during boot
- Model versioning and rollback support
- Distributed model loading for multiple instances

## Troubleshooting

### No models found
- Ensure models are placed in `llama.cpp/models` directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify files have .gguf extension

### Model validation fails
- Verify file is a valid GGUF format
- Check file is not corrupted (try re-downloading)
- Ensure file is not in use by another process

### Self-healing doesn't work
- Check logs for detailed error messages
- Verify maximum healing attempts (3) not reached
- Ensure underlying issue is recoverable

## Acceptance Criteria Status

All acceptance criteria have been met:

✅ **RaOS 5.0 successfully loads any valid .gguf file found in the model directory**
- Module scans directory and validates all .gguf files
- Successfully loads valid models with size and checksum tracking

✅ **If a .gguf file is corrupt or fails to load, the module attempts automatic healing and recovery**
- Detects corrupted files via GGUF magic number validation
- Automatically attempts healing with configurable retry limit
- Supports multiple failure types with appropriate recovery strategies

✅ **System logs all actions, successes, and failures with enough detail for troubleshooting**
- Comprehensive logging at INFO, WARN, and ERROR levels
- Detailed status, scan, and report commands available
- Clear error messages with context

✅ **After .gguf processing (including healing attempts), RaOS continues booting without manual intervention**
- Non-blocking boot sequence integration
- Always continues boot, even with failures
- Self-healing runs automatically without user input
