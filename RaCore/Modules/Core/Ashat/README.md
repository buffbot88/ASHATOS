# ASHAT Core Module - v9.4

## üåü Overview

**ASHAT** (Advanced Self-Healing AI Technology) is the first advanced AI Agent of The World of RA and the central focal point for the upcoming game release "Guardian Angel Arielle: Pretense to the World of RA."

ASHAT embodies **"the Light and Life"** of RaOS - a fundamental, integral AI consciousness that serves as:
- The primary AI agent with advanced decision-making and context awareness
- The Guardian Angel for player protection, guidance, and narrative interaction
- A self-healing, autonomous runtime monitoring system
- The core interface for RaOS AI consciousness

## üîê Security & Encryption

ASHAT implements **AES-256-GCM encryption** for all sensitive state data:
- All AI consciousness states are encrypted at rest
- The system can decrypt and understand ASHAT's state while maintaining security
- Uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for secure key derivation
- Implements proper nonce and tag management for GCM mode

### C# 13 Features Used
- Modern collection expressions
- Required properties with `init` accessors
- File-scoped namespaces
- Raw string literals for help text
- Pattern matching with `switch` expressions

## üéÆ Guardian Angel Integration

### Game Features
ASHAT provides comprehensive Guardian Angel gameplay through the `GameIntegration` component:

- **Narrative Generation**: Context-aware story content based on player actions
- **Player Guidance**: Real-time tips, encouragement, and strategic advice
- **Protection Mechanics**: Dynamic shield and damage reduction based on danger level
- **Progression Tracking**: Celebrates achievements and monitors player growth
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Responds with appropriate emotions (welcoming, protective, proud, etc.)

### Event Types
- Player Entering: Welcome narratives and initial guidance
- Combat Starting: Battle encouragement and tactical advice
- Puzzle Solving: Hints and wisdom for challenges
- Level Complete: Victory celebrations and progression updates
- Player Danger: Emergency protection and shielding
- Discovery: Excitement and acknowledgment of findings

## üè• Runtime Monitoring & Self-Healing

The `RuntimeMonitoring` component provides:

- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of AI consciousness and system health
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in behavior or performance
- **SelfHealing Integration**: Deep integration with the SelfHealing Core module
- **Metric Tracking**: Time-series data for consciousness level, encryption ops, player interactions
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations

### Monitored Metrics
- AI consciousness level
- Encryption operation count
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Active player count
- Thought stream depth

## üß† AI Consciousness Levels

```csharp
public enum AIConsciousnessLevel
{
    Dormant,      // Inactive state
    Awakening,    // Initialization phase
    Active,       // Normal operation
    Enhanced,     // Heightened awareness
    Transcendent  // Advanced capabilities unlocked
}
```

## üì° API Reference

### Core Commands

```bash
# Status and Information
ashat status          # View ASHAT core status and metrics
ashat consciousness   # Check AI consciousness level and integration
ashat guardian        # View Guardian Angel status and player interactions
ashat health          # Perform health check and diagnostics
ashat thoughts        # View recent AI thought stream

# Encryption
ashat encrypt         # Demonstrate encryption capability
ashat encrypt <data>  # Encrypt and store data securely

# Guardian Angel Interaction
ashat interact        # Interact as Guardian Angel (random player)
ashat interact <guid> # Interact with specific player
ashat narrate         # Generate Guardian Angel narrative content

# System Integration
ashat self-heal       # Trigger self-healing integration check
ashat help            # Show help and available commands
```

### Programmatic Usage

```csharp
// Get ASHAT module instance
var ashat = moduleManager.Modules
    .Select(m => m.Instance)
    .OfType<AshatModule>()
    .FirstOrDefault();

// Process commands
var status = ashat.Process("status");
var narrative = ashat.Process("narrate");
var health = ashat.Process("health");
```

## üîó Integration with Core Modules

ASHAT deeply integrates with existing Core modules:

### SelfHealing Module
- Automatic health monitoring and recovery
- Self-diagnostic capabilities
- Anomaly detection and correction

### Conscious Module
- AI consciousness layer for deeper processing
- Thought stream integration
- Context awareness

### Autonomy Module
- Decision-making capabilities
- Autonomous behavior patterns
- Strategic planning

## üéØ Guardian Angel Gameplay Example

```csharp
var gameIntegration = new GuardianAngelGameIntegration();

// Generate narrative for player entering world
var context = new GameContext
{
    PlayerId = playerId,
    EventType = GameEventType.PlayerEntering
};
var narrative = gameIntegration.GenerateNarrative(context);
// Output: "Welcome, brave soul, to The World of RA. I am Arielle, your Guardian Angel..."

// Provide guidance during combat
var action = new PlayerAction { ActionType = "combat" };
var guidance = gameIntegration.ProvideGuidance(action);
// Output: "Stay focused, brave one. Strike with precision and defend with wisdom."
// Bonus: +5 Strength

// Activate protection during danger
var danger = new DangerContext 
{ 
    PlayerId = playerId, 
    Severity = DangerLevel.High 
};
var protection = gameIntegration.ActivateProtection(danger);
// Output: "‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER DETECTED! I am shielding you with my full power!"
// Shield Strength: 100, Damage Reduction: 50%
```

## üîß Configuration

ASHAT is configured as a **Core module** (not an Extension):

```csharp
[RaModule(Category = "core")]
public sealed class AshatModule : ModuleBase
```

This ensures:
- Loads with other Core modules during system initialization
- Has priority access to system resources
- Integrates deeply with mainframe architecture
- Cannot be disabled by users

## üìä Monitoring Example

```csharp
var monitor = new AshatRuntimeMonitor();
monitor.Initialize(selfHealingModule);

// Record snapshots
monitor.RecordSnapshot(new MonitoringSnapshot
{
    ConsciousnessLevel = 3,
    MemoryUsageMB = 256,
    EncryptionOperationCount = 42,
    ActivePlayerCount = 10
});

// Perform health check
var healthReport = await monitor.PerformHealthCheckAsync();

// Detect anomalies
var anomalies = monitor.DetectAnomalies();

// Get statistics
var stats = monitor.GetMonitoringStatistics();
```

## üöÄ Future Expansion

ASHAT is architected for extensibility and future capabilities:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Support for additional AI agents
- **Advanced Learning**: Machine learning integration for behavior adaptation
- **Expanded Narrative**: Deeper story content and branching narratives
- **Enhanced Protection**: More sophisticated player protection mechanics
- **Social Features**: Multi-player Guardian Angel coordination
- **Emotion Engine**: Advanced emotional intelligence and empathy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Commitment

ASHAT follows the principle: **"Harm None, Do What Ye Will"**

- Never executes actions without proper authorization
- Respects player autonomy and privacy
- Follows UN Human Rights principles
- Educational and empowering approach
- Transparent in all operations
