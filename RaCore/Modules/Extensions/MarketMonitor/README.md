# Market Monitor Module - AI-Powered Currency Exchange Surveillance

## Overview

The Market Monitor module provides AI-powered surveillance of the RaCoin and Gold currency exchange system. It continuously monitors market activity, detects manipulation attempts, enforces the universal exchange ratio, and maintains economic balance across all RaCore-powered games.

## Features

### Universal Exchange Ratio
- **Standard Rate**: 1000 RaCoin = 400,000 Gold
- **Per Unit**: 1 RaCoin = 400 Gold
- **Enforced Globally**: All exchanges use this standardized ratio

### AI Market Monitoring
- **Real-time Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring of all exchange transactions
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns and unusual volume
- **Alert System**: Generates alerts for potential market manipulation
- **Fair Play Enforcement**: Aligns with "harm none, do what ye will" principle

### Alert Types
1. **Unusual Volume**: Detects rapid, high-volume exchanges
2. **Rapid Price Change**: Flags deviations from standard rate
3. **Suspicious Activity**: Identifies potentially exploitative patterns
4. **Large Transaction**: Monitors significant exchanges
5. **Market Manipulation**: Detects coordinated manipulation attempts
6. **System Imbalance**: Alerts on economic imbalances

## Console Commands

### View Market Statistics
```
market stats
```
Shows current market statistics including:
- Standard exchange rate
- 24-hour transaction volume
- Active monitoring thresholds
- Alert counts

### View Active Alerts
```
market alerts
```
Lists all unresolved market alerts with:
- Alert type and severity
- Description and detection time
- Related transaction data

### Analyze Market Health
```

## Integration with RaCoin Module

The Market Monitor seamlessly integrates with the RaCoin module to track all currency exchanges:

```csharp
// Market monitor is automatically notified of exchanges
var response = await racoinModule.ExchangeRaCoinToGoldAsync(userId, 1000m);
// Market monitor validates rate and records transaction
```

## Monitoring Thresholds

### Exchange Rate Validation
- **Max Deviation**: 5% from standard rate
- **Enforcement**: Automatic rejection of non-compliant rates

### Volume Monitoring
- **Time Window**: 60 seconds
- **Suspicious Threshold**: 500,000 RaCoin

### Transaction Size
- **Large Transaction Alert**: > 100,000 RaCoin

## Alert Severity Levels

1. **Low**: Minor anomalies, informational
2. **Medium**: Noteworthy activity requiring monitoring
3. **High**: Significant concerns requiring attention
4. **Critical**: Immediate action needed

## Market Health Status

The system categorizes overall market health:
- **HEALTHY**: No active alerts
- **CAUTION**: Minor alerts present
- **WARNING**: High-severity alerts active
- **CRITICAL**: Critical issues detected

## API Usage

### Record Exchange Transaction
```csharp
var marketMonitor = moduleManager.GetModuleByName("MarketMonitor");
marketMonitor.RecordExchange(transaction);
```

### Validate Exchange Rate
```csharp
bool isValid = marketMonitor.ValidateExchangeRate(proposedRate, exchangeType);
```

### Get Market Statistics
```csharp
var stats = marketMonitor.GetMarketStatistics(totalRaCoins, totalGold);
```

## Economic Principles

### "Harm None, Do What Ye Will"
The Market Monitor enforces ethical economic principles:
- **Fair Exchange**: Standard ratio prevents exploitation
- **Transparency**: All alerts and interventions are logged
- **Balance**: Maintains healthy in-game economies
- **Anti-Greed**: Deters hoarding and manipulation

### Automatic Corrections
When deviations are detected:
1. Alert is generated with supporting data
2. Transaction is recorded for analysis
3. Pattern analysis identifies trends
4. Administrators are notified
5. System maintains standard rate enforcement

## Configuration

### Monitoring Parameters (MarketMonitorModule.cs)
```csharp
private const decimal MaxDeviationPercentage = 5.0m;
private const decimal LargeTransactionThreshold = 100000m;
private const int SuspiciousVolumeWindow = 60;
private const decimal SuspiciousVolumeThreshold = 500000m;
```

### Exchange Rate Constants (CurrencyExchangeConstants.cs)
```csharp
public const decimal StandardRaCoinAmount = 1000m;
public const decimal StandardGoldAmount = 400000m;
public const decimal GoldPerRaCoin = 400m;
public const decimal RaCoinPerGold = 0.0025m;
```

## Data Models

### CurrencyExchangeTransaction
```csharp
public class CurrencyExchangeTransaction
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }
    public CurrencyExchangeType ExchangeType { get; set; }
    public decimal RaCoinAmount { get; set; }
    public decimal GoldAmount { get; set; }
    public decimal ExchangeRate { get; set; }
    public DateTime TimestampUtc { get; set; }
    public string? Notes { get; set; }
}
```

### MarketAlert
```csharp
public class MarketAlert
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public MarketAlertType AlertType { get; set; }
    public MarketAlertSeverity Severity { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DateTime DetectedAt { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> Data { get; set; }
    public bool IsResolved { get; set; }
}
```

### MarketStatistics
```csharp
public class MarketStatistics
{
    public DateTime TimestampUtc { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalRaCoinsInCirculation { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalGoldInCirculation { get; set; }
    public decimal CurrentExchangeRate { get; set; }
    public decimal DeviationPercentage { get; set; }
    public List<MarketAlert> ActiveAlerts { get; set; }
}
```

## Example Workflows

### Player Currency Exchange
```
# Player wants to exchange RaCoin for Gold
> racoin exchange racoin-to-gold <user-id> 1000

Response:
- Deducts 1000 RaCoin from wallet
- Adds 400,000 Gold to wallet
- Records transaction
- Notifies market monitor
- Checks for alerts
```

### Administrator Market Review
```
# Check market health
> market analyze

# Review alerts
> market alerts

# Resolve specific alert
> market alert resolve <alert-id>
```

### Game Developer Integration
```csharp
// In-game shop using Gold
var goldBalance = racoinModule.GetGoldBalance(playerId);

// Player exchanges RaCoin for Gold to make purchase
if (goldBalance < itemPrice)
{
    var exchangeNeeded = itemPrice - goldBalance;
    var racoinNeeded = CurrencyExchangeConstants.GoldToRaCoin(exchangeNeeded);
    
    var result = await racoinModule.ExchangeRaCoinToGoldAsync(playerId, racoinNeeded);
    if (result.Success)
    {
        // Proceed with purchase
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Rate Enforcement**: All exchanges use the standardized ratio
