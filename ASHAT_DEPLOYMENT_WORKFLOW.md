## Overview

The ASHAT Deployment Workflow Module implements a comprehensive push-to-public-server workflow for RaOS ALPHA/OMEGA development. It provides a structured, approval-based deployment pipeline that ensures updates are properly tested and verified before reaching production.

### Key Features

- **ALPHA → Public Server → OMEGA Pipeline**: Structured deployment workflow with staging verification
- **Approval-Based Process**: No automatic deployments - all changes require explicit approval
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in verification checks on Public Server before OMEGA deployment
- **Deployment History**: Complete tracking of all deployments with audit trail
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback of failed deployments
- **OMEGA Distribution**: Automatic distribution to Licensed Mainframes upon approval
- **Cloud Architecture Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for future cloud integration

### Architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- RaOS Core 9.4.0 or higher
- ASHAT module enabled
- Access to Public Server (staging)
- OMEGA server configured (for production deployments)

### Initial Setup

1. **Access the AshatDeployment Module**

   ```bash
   # In RaOS, load the deployment module
   deploy help
   ```

2. **Configure Public Server**

   ```bash
   deploy configure public http://staging.example.com PublicStaging
   ```

3. **Configure OMEGA Server** (for production deployments)

   ```bash
   deploy configure omega https://omega.example.com OmegaProduction
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration**

   ```bash
   deploy servers
   ```

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Initiate Deployment

Push your update from ALPHA to the Public Server:

```bash
deploy push <update-id> <description> [additional-info]
```

**Example:**
```bash
deploy push patch-v1.2.3 'Security fixes and performance improvements' 'Fixes CVE-2024-001'
```

**Output:**
- Deployment session created
- Action plan generated
- Estimated timeline provided

#### 2. Verify on Public Server

Run automated tests and verification checks:

```bash
deploy verify <update-id>
```

**Verification Checks:**
- ✅ Health Check
- ✅ Module Load Test
- ✅ API Endpoint Test
- ✅ Database Connection
- ✅ Performance Baseline
- ✅ Security Scan

#### 3. Review Results

If all checks pass, you'll see:
```
✅ Verification PASSED!
Public Server deployment is stable and ready for OMEGA.
```

If checks fail:
```
❌ Verification FAILED!
Issues detected on Public Server. Deployment cannot proceed to OMEGA.
```

#### 4. Approve for OMEGA (Production)

After successful verification:

```bash
deploy approve <update-id>
```

**This triggers:**
1. Packaging of approved update
2. Push to OMEGA server
3. Automatic distribution to Licensed Mainframes
4. SERVER OWNER LEVEL updates propagation

#### 5. Monitor & Review

Check deployment status and history:

```bash
deploy status    # Active deployments
deploy history   # Deployment history
```

### Alternative Actions

**Rollback a Deployment:**
```bash
deploy rollback <update-id>
```

**Cancel a Deployment:**
```bash
deploy cancel <update-id>
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Security Patch Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure servers (first time only)
deploy configure public http://staging.raos.io Staging
deploy configure omega https://omega.raos.io Production

# 2. Push security patch
deploy push security-patch-001 'Critical security fixes for authentication module'

# 3. Verify on staging
deploy verify security-patch-001

# 4. If verification passes, approve for production
deploy approve security-patch-001

# 5. Check deployment history
deploy history
```

### Example 2: Feature Update with Rollback

```bash
# 1. Push feature update
deploy push feature-2024-q1 'New dashboard and analytics features'

# 2. Verify
deploy verify feature-2024-q1

# 3. If issues detected, rollback
deploy rollback feature-2024-q1

# 4. Fix issues and try again
deploy push feature-2024-q1-fixed 'Dashboard features (fixed)'
deploy verify feature-2024-q1-fixed
deploy approve feature-2024-q1-fixed
```

### Example 3: Multiple Parallel Deployments

```bash
# Deploy multiple updates in parallel
deploy push hotfix-001 'Critical bug fix'
deploy push feature-update 'New feature'
deploy push docs-update 'Documentation updates'

# Check status of all deployments
deploy status

# Verify and approve each separately
deploy verify hotfix-001
deploy approve hotfix-001

deploy verify feature-update
deploy approve feature-update
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Deployment Planning

- ✅ Always test locally (ALPHA) before pushing to Public Server
- ✅ Use descriptive update IDs (e.g., `v1.2.3`, `hotfix-auth-001`)
- ✅ Include clear descriptions of changes
- ✅ Schedule major deployments during low-traffic periods

### 2. Verification

- ✅ Always run `deploy verify` before approval
- ✅ Review all verification check results
- ✅ Test critical functionality manually on Public Server if needed
- ✅ Don't skip verification even for "minor" updates

### 3. OMEGA Deployments

- ✅ Only approve well-tested updates for OMEGA
- ✅ Have a rollback plan ready
- ✅ Monitor OMEGA server after deployment
- ✅ Keep team informed of production deployments

### 4. Error Handling

- ✅ Use `deploy rollback` immediately if issues are detected
- ✅ Review failed verification checks carefully
- ✅ Don't force approvals for failed verifications
- ✅ Document issues and fixes in deployment history

### 5. Security

- ✅ Protect OMEGA server configuration
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all server URLs
- ✅ Validate server certificates
- ✅ Limit deployment permissions to authorized personnel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Public Server not configured"

**Problem:** Attempting to push without configuring the Public Server.

**Solution:**
```bash
deploy configure public http://your-staging-server.com StagingServer
```

#### Issue: "Deployment session already exists"

**Problem:** Trying to create a deployment with an ID that's already in use.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Cancel existing deployment
deploy cancel <update-id>

# Or use a different update ID
deploy push <new-update-id> 'Description'
```

#### Issue: "Verification FAILED"

**Problem:** Public Server verification checks failed.

**Solution:**
1. Review failed checks
2. Fix issues in ALPHA environment
3. Rollback current deployment: `deploy rollback <update-id>`
4. Create new deployment with fixes

#### Issue: "OMEGA Server not configured"

**Problem:** Attempting to approve deployment without OMEGA configuration.

**Solution:**
```bash
deploy configure omega https://your-production-server.com ProductionServer
```

#### Issue: "Not ready for approval"

**Problem:** Trying to approve before running verification.

**Solution:**
```bash
deploy verify <update-id>
# Wait for verification to complete, then:
deploy approve <update-id>
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
deploy status

# List configured servers
deploy servers

# View deployment history
