  Environment                                     Licensed Mainframes
```

**Workflow Stages:**
1. **Push** - Deploy from ALPHA to Public Server
2. **Verify** - Run automated tests on Public Server
3. **Approve** - Push verified updates to OMEGA
4. **Distribute** - OMEGA distributes to Licensed Mainframes

---

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Configure servers (one-time)
deploy configure public http://staging.example.com PublicStaging
deploy configure omega https://omega.example.com OmegaProduction

# Deploy workflow
deploy push update-001 'Description of changes'
deploy verify update-001
deploy approve update-001

# Monitoring
deploy status
deploy history
deploy servers
```

### Example Session

```bash
$ deploy push security-patch-001 'Critical security fixes'
🚀 ASHAT Deployment Workflow Initiated
Update ID: security-patch-001
Target: PublicStaging
📋 Deployment Plan: 4 steps

$ deploy verify security-patch-001
🔍 ASHAT Deployment Verification
✅ Health Check: Server responding normally
✅ Module Load Test: All modules loaded successfully
...
✅ Verification PASSED!

$ deploy approve security-patch-001
🎉 ASHAT Deployment to OMEGA Approved!
📤 Distributing to Licensed Mainframes
✅ Deployment completed successfully!
```
