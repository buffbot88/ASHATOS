# Ashat AI Coding Assistant - Quick Start Guide

> **Ashat** (pronounced AH-SH-AHT) - The Face of RaOS, your intelligent AI coding companion

## 🎯 What is Ashat?

Ashat is an AI-powered coding assistant integrated into RaOS that helps developers:
- Create new modules with guided workflows
- Debug and fix issues with intelligent analysis
- Learn about the RaOS architecture and modules
- Get contextual coding assistance
- Work through an approval-based workflow

**Key Principle:** Ashat works **WITH** you, not **FOR** you. She forms action plans and requests your approval before making any changes.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Access Ashat

Ashat is available immediately after starting RaCore:

```bash
cd RaCore
dotnet run
```

Once RaCore is running, use any of these commands to interact with Ashat.

### 2. Basic Commands

```bash
# Get help
ashat help

# List all available modules
ashat modules

# Get information about a specific module
ashat module info AICodeGen

# Ask a question
ashat ask How do I create a new module?

# Check status
ashat status
```

### 3. Start a Coding Session

The most powerful way to use Ashat is through guided sessions:

```bash
ashat start session yourname Create a weather forecast module
```

**What happens:**
1. Ashat analyzes your goal
2. Identifies relevant modules (e.g., AICodeGen, ModuleSpawner)
3. Asks clarifying questions
4. Creates an action plan
5. Waits for your approval

### 4. Continue the Conversation

```bash
ashat continue yourname It should fetch from OpenWeather API and cache results
```

**What happens:**
1. Ashat refines the action plan based on your input
2. Shows you exactly what will be done
3. Requests approval to proceed

### 5. Approve and Execute

```bash
ashat approve yourname
```

**What happens:**
1. Ashat executes the approved plan
2. Provides implementation guidance
3. Offers next steps

### 6. Complete the Session

```bash
ashat end session yourname
```

**What happens:**
1. Session summary is shown
2. Statistics are provided
3. Session is closed

## 📋 Common Use Cases

### Learn About the System

```bash
# Discover available modules
ashat modules

# Get details about a module
ashat module info Chat
ashat module info AICodeGen

# Ask questions
ashat ask What modules handle authentication?
ashat ask How does the Knowledge module work?
```

### Create a New Module

```bash
# Start the session
ashat start session dev001 Create a notification system module

# Provide details
ashat continue dev001 It should send email and SMS notifications

# Review the plan and approve
ashat approve dev001

# Complete when done
ashat end session dev001
```

### Debug an Issue

```bash
# Start debugging session
ashat start session debug001 Fix null reference in ChatModule

# Provide context
ashat continue debug001 Error occurs in JoinRoomAsync when room doesn't exist

# Review solution and approve
ashat approve debug001

# End session
ashat end session debug001
```

## 🎓 Integration Points

### Chat Support System
- Access Ashat through chat with `@ashat` or `ashat` prefix
- Real-time assistance during development
- Persistent sessions across chat rooms

### Dev Pages
- Context-sensitive help based on current page
- Module references and documentation
- Interactive guidance

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "Create a module", try "Create a user notification module with email and SMS support"

2. **Iterate**: Don't worry about getting it perfect first time. Use `ashat continue` to refine.

3. **Ask Questions**: Use `ashat ask` before starting complex tasks to understand the system.

4. **Check Status**: Use `ashat status` to see active sessions and Ashat's state.

5. **Explore First**: Use `ashat modules` to discover what's already available.

## 🔧 Configuration

Ashat works out-of-the-box with no configuration required. However, she integrates with:

- **Speech Module**: For natural language AI responses
- **Chat Module**: For chat system integration
- **AICodeGen**: For code generation
- **Knowledge**: For documentation lookup

## 🎯 Example Session

Here's a complete example:

```bash
# Start
$ ashat start session alice Create a weather module

→ Ashat: Hello! I'm Ashat, your AI coding companion.
→ Ashat: I understand you want to: Create a weather module
→ Ashat: Relevant modules I found:
→   • AICodeGen - Generates code and project structures
→   • AIContent - Creates game assets and content
→ Ashat: What specific aspect would you like to focus on first?

# Continue
$ ashat continue alice Fetch from OpenWeather API every hour

→ Ashat: Based on your goal and input, here's my proposed action plan:
→ Steps:
→   1. Analyze requirements and identify module type
→   2. Generate module structure and boilerplate code
→   3. Review generated code with developer
→   4. Test and validate the module
→ Ashat: ⚠️ Before I proceed, I need your approval.

# Approve
$ ashat approve alice

→ Ashat: ✅ Action plan approved!
→ Ashat: Proceeding with execution...

# End
$ ashat end session alice

→ Ashat: === Session Summary ===
→ Goal: Create a weather module
→ Duration: 8.5 minutes
→ Status: Completed
→ Thank you for working with me! 🚀
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Ashat doesn't respond
- Verify RaCore is running
- Check command format: starts with `ashat`
- Try `ashat help`

### Session not found
- Ensure you started a session first: `ashat start session <userId> <goal>`
- Use correct userId in commands
- Check active sessions: `ashat status`

### Need to start over
```bash
ashat end session yourname
ashat start session yourname <new goal>
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Try it yourself**: Start with a simple session
2. **Explore modules**: Learn what's available with `ashat modules`
3. **Ask questions**: Use `ashat ask` to learn about RaOS
4. **Build something**: Create a real module with Ashat's guidance
