## Architecture

```
MemoryModule (Storage + Maintenance)
    ↓
MemoryMetrics (20+ metrics tracked)
    ↓
MemoryAlerts (6 types, 3 severities)
    ↓
MemoryHealthMonitor (Continuous monitoring)
    ↓

## Default Configuration

Designed for production use out-of-the-box:

```
Memory Limits:
  - Max Age: 90 days
  - Max Items: 10,000 items

Schedules:
  - Maintenance: Every 24 hours
  - Health Checks: Every 5 minutes

Alert Thresholds:
  - Capacity Warning: 75%
  - Capacity Critical: 90%
  - Disk Warning: 100 MB
