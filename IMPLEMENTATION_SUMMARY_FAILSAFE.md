# Failsafe Backup System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive Failsafe Backup System to RaOS as requested in issue "[BUG] Failsafe Backup". The system provides SuperAdmin-level emergency backup, system state comparison, investigation, and restoration capabilities to protect RaOS from corruption.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. FailsafeModule (527 lines)
**Location**: `RaCore/Modules/Extensions/Safety/FailsafeModule.cs`

A complete module that provides:
- **Password Management**: Encrypted failsafe password storage
- **Backup Creation**: Emergency and manual backup creation
- **System State Capture**: Records users, licenses, sessions, and system metrics
- **Comparison Engine**: Compares current state with last safe backup
- **Investigation Logic**: Detects anomalies and generates recommendations
- **Restoration Manager**: Restores system to previous backup state

#### Key Commands
- `failsafe setpassword <password>` - Set encrypted failsafe password (SuperAdmin)
- `help_failsafe -start <passkey>` - Trigger emergency backup with investigation
- `failsafe status` - Check failsafe system status
- `failsafe backups` - List all backups with details
- `failsafe marksafe <backup-id>` - Mark backup as safe environment
- `failsafe restore <backup-id>` - Restore from backup
- `help_failsafe` - Detailed failsafe help

#### Security Features
- Encrypted password storage using SHA256
- Server License passkey validation
- SuperAdmin-only access
- Complete audit logging
- All operations timestamped

### 2. License Model Extensions
**Files Modified**: 
- `Abstractions/AuthModels.cs`
- `Abstractions/ILicenseModule.cs`
- `RaCore/Modules/Extensions/License/LicenseModule.cs`

**Changes**:
- Added `FailsafePasswordHash` property to License model
- Added `FailsafePasswordSetAtUtc` timestamp to License model
- Implemented `SetFailsafePassword()` method
- Implemented `ValidateFailsafePassword()` method
- Implemented `GetServerLicense()` method to retrieve unexpirable license

### 3. Data Models

#### FailsafeBackup
```csharp
public class FailsafeBackup
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }           // EMERGENCY, MANUAL, etc.
    public string Reason { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAtUtc { get; set; }
    public SystemState State { get; set; }
    public bool IsSafe { get; set; }
}
```

#### SystemState
```csharp
public class SystemState
{
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public int TotalUsers { get; set; }
    public int ActiveSessions { get; set; }
    public int TotalLicenses { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> SystemMetrics { get; set; }
}
```

#### ComparisonResult
```csharp
public class ComparisonResult
{
    public bool HasSafeBackup { get; set; }
    public Guid? SafeBackupId { get; set; }
    public DateTime? SafeBackupTimestamp { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public List<string> Issues { get; set; }
    public List<string> Changes { get; set; }
}
```

## How It Works

### Initial Setup Flow
1. SuperAdmin logs in and updates password
2. System prompts to set failsafe password
3. SuperAdmin executes: `failsafe setpassword <password>`
4. Password is encrypted and stored in Server License
5. System confirms setup complete

### Emergency Backup Flow
1. SuperAdmin suspects corruption or issue
2. Executes: `help_failsafe -start <SERVER_LICENSE_PASSKEY>`
3. System validates passkey
4. Creates immediate emergency backup
5. Captures complete system state
6. Compares with last known safe backup (if exists)
7. Generates investigation report with:
   - List of detected issues
   - List of changes
   - Restoration recommendations
8. Returns detailed JSON response

### Investigation Process
The system automatically:
- Compares user counts (current vs safe)
- Compares license counts (current vs safe)
- Identifies decreases as potential issues
- Lists changes that are non-critical
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Suggests restoration if corruption detected

### Restoration Flow
1. SuperAdmin reviews backup list
2. Identifies appropriate backup to restore
3. Executes: `failsafe restore <backup-id>`
4. System restores system state
5. Provides verification steps
6. SuperAdmin validates system integrity
7. Creates new safe backup if stable

## Security Implementation

### Password Encryption
- Uses SHA256 hashing
- Password stored in License model
- Not accessible through regular API
- Requires SuperAdmin role

### Access Control
- All failsafe operations: SuperAdmin only
- License passkey required for emergency trigger
- Complete audit trail
- Timestamps prevent replay attacks

### Audit Logging
All operations logged:
- Failsafe password changes
- Backup creation
- Safe backup marking
- Restoration attempts
- Investigation results

## Integration Points

### Authentication Module
- Validates SuperAdmin role
- Provides user data for backups
- Logs security events

### License Module
- Stores encrypted failsafe password
- Validates Server License passkey
- Provides license data for backups
- Tracks license state changes

### Module Manager
- Provides system metrics
- Tracks loaded modules
- Facilitates state capture
