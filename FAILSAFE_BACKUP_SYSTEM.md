# 🛡️ RaOS Failsafe Backup System

## Overview

The Failsafe Backup System is a critical security feature designed to prevent and recover from RaOS corruption. It provides SuperAdmin-level emergency backup, system state comparison, and restoration capabilities.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Security
- **Encrypted Password Storage**: Failsafe password is encrypted and stored in the Server License
- **SuperAdmin-Only Access**: Only SuperAdmin can configure and trigger failsafe operations
- **License Validation**: Requires valid Server License passkey to trigger emergency backups
- **Audit Trail**: All failsafe operations are logged for security and compliance

### 💾 Backup Capabilities
- **Emergency Backups**: Create immediate system snapshots on demand
- **Safe Environment Tracking**: Mark known-good backups as "safe" for comparison
- **Automatic Comparison**: Compare current state against last safe backup
- **System State Capture**: Records users, licenses, sessions, and system metrics

### 🔍 Investigation & Analysis
- **Issue Detection**: Automatically identifies anomalies by comparing states
- **Change Tracking**: Lists all changes between current and safe states
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides actionable recommendations based on findings
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Helps isolate corruption sources

### 🔄 Restoration
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to any previous backup
- **Safe Rollback**: Revert to last known safe environment
- **Verification Steps**: Guided post-restoration verification process

- **State**: Captured system state
- **IsSafe**: Safe environment flag

#### SystemState
- **Timestamp**: When state was captured
- **TotalUsers**: User count
- **ActiveSessions**: Active session count
- **TotalLicenses**: License count
- **SystemMetrics**: Additional metrics dictionary

#### ComparisonResult
- **HasSafeBackup**: Whether a safe backup exists

- **Message**: Summary message
- **Issues**: List of detected issues
- **Changes**: List of non-critical changes

## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup (First Time)

#### 1. Set Failsafe Password

After SuperAdmin first login and password update, they should set a failsafe password:

```bash
failsafe setpassword <your-secure-password>
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be at least 8 characters
- Only SuperAdmin can set this password
- Password is encrypted and stored in Server License
- This is a one-time setup (can be changed later)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "Failsafe password set successfully",
  "Timestamp": "2025-01-13T12:00:00Z",
  "Note": "Password encrypted and stored securely"
}
```

#### 2. Create Initial Safe Backup

Create a baseline backup when system is in known-good state:

```bash
failsafe setpassword <password>
```

Then manually create a backup and mark it as safe (this will be done automatically on first trigger).

### Emergency Operations

#### Trigger Failsafe Backup

When corruption is suspected or an emergency occurs:

```bash
help_failsafe -start <SERVER_LICENSE_PASSKEY>
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Validates Server License passkey
2. 💾 Creates immediate emergency backup
3. 🔍 Compares with last safe backup
4. 📊 Generates investigation report
5. 💡 Provides restoration recommendations

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "Emergency failsafe backup created",
  "BackupId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "Timestamp": "2025-01-13T12:30:00Z",
  "Investigation": {
    "Status": "Investigating",
    "LastSafeBackup": "450e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "Comparison": {
      "HasSafeBackup": true,
      "Message": "Issues detected",
      "Issues": [
        "User count decreased: 150 -> 120",
        "License count decreased: 45 -> 40"
      ],
      "Changes": []
    },
    "Recommendations": [
      "RECOMMENDED: Restore from last safe backup",
      "Investigate missing users and licenses",
      "Review audit logs for suspicious activity"
    ]
  },
  "NextSteps": [
    "Review the comparison results",
    "Investigate identified issues",
    "Restore from backup if needed"
  ]
}
```

### Backup Management

#### View All Backups

```bash
failsafe backups
```

Lists all backups with:
- Backup ID
- Type (EMERGENCY, MANUAL, etc.)
- Creation timestamp
- Safe status
- System state summary

#### Mark Backup as Safe

When you verify a backup represents a safe, uncorrupted state:

```bash
failsafe marksafe <backup-id>
```

This backup becomes the baseline for future comparisons.

#### Check Failsafe Status

```bash
failsafe status
```

Shows:
- Whether failsafe password is set
- Total number of backups
- Number of safe backups
- Last safe backup ID
- System operational status

### Restoration

#### Restore from Backup

To restore the system to a previous state:

```bash
failsafe restore <backup-id>
```

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ This will restore users, licenses, and system configuration
- 📋 Review the backup details before restoring
- ✅ Verify system integrity after restoration
- 💾 Consider creating a backup before restoration

**Post-Restoration Steps:**
1. Verify system functionality
2. Check user accounts and licenses
3. Review restored data
4. Create a new safe backup if system is stable

## Command Reference

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description | SuperAdmin Only |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Safe Backups
- Mark backups as safe when system is stable
- Update safe backup after major changes
- Maintain at least 2-3 safe backups

### 2. Password Security
- Use a strong, unique failsafe password
- Store password securely (separate from admin password)
- Don't share failsafe password
- Change password periodically

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Trigger failsafe after detecting anomalies
- Don't wait if corruption is suspected
- Document the reason for each emergency trigger

### 4. Investigation Process
1. Review the comparison results
2. Check audit logs for the time period
3. Identify root cause
4. Take corrective action
5. Create new safe backup if resolved

### 5. Restoration Guidelines
- Always review backup state before restoring
- Understand what data will be affected
- Communicate with users about restoration
- Have a rollback plan

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Failsafe operations**: SuperAdmin only
- **Password storage**: Encrypted in Server License
- **License validation**: Required for emergency triggers
- **Audit logging**: All operations logged

### Password Management
- Minimum 8 characters required
- Encrypted using SHA256
- Stored in Server License metadata
- Not accessible through regular API

### Backup Security
- Backups stored in-memory (production would use persistent storage)
- Access controlled via SuperAdmin role
- Timestamps prevent replay attacks
- Audit trail for all operations

## Integration Points

### Authentication Module
- Validates SuperAdmin role
- Provides user data for backups
- Logs security events

### License Module
- Stores encrypted failsafe password
- Validates Server License passkey
- Provides license data for backups

### Audit System
- All failsafe operations logged
- Investigation results recorded
- Restoration events tracked

## Terminal Integration Flow

### On SuperAdmin Login
1. SuperAdmin logs in successfully
2. System prompts for password update (if required)
3. After password update, redirect to Terminal Page

### First Terminal Connection
1. Check if failsafe password is set
2. If not set, prompt: "Set failsafe password for emergency backup system"
3. SuperAdmin enters and confirms password
4. System encrypts and stores in Server License
5. Confirmation message displayed
6. Normal terminal operations begin

### Subsequent Terminal Connections
1. Check if failsafe password is set
2. If set, show system status in terminal
3. Normal operations continue

## Troubleshooting

### Failsafe Password Not Set
**Error**: "Failsafe password not set"
**Solution**: Run `failsafe setpassword <password>` to configure

### Invalid License Passkey
**Error**: "Invalid server license passkey"
**Solution**: Verify you have the correct Server License passkey

### No Safe Backup Found
**Warning**: "No safe backup found for comparison"
**Solution**: Mark your first stable backup as safe using `failsafe marksafe <backup-id>`

### Restore Failed
**Issue**: Restoration doesn't complete
**Solution**: Check logs, verify backup integrity, contact support
