## API Usage

```csharp
// Get module
var supportModule = GetModule<ISupportChatModule>();

// Start appeal
var appeal = await supportModule.StartAppealAsync(userId, statement);

// Submit response
var response = await supportModule.SubmitAppealResponseAsync(userId, answer);

// Get decision
var decision = await supportModule.GetAppealDecisionAsync(userId);

// Check outcome
if (decision?.Outcome == AppealOutcome.Approved)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Appeal approved!");
}
```

## integration

### With ContentmoderationModule

```csharp
// Check suspension
if (await _moderationModule.IsUserSuspendedAsync(userId))
{
    // Get details
    var suspension = await _moderationModule.GetActiveSuspensionAsync(userId);
    
    // Can start appeal
}

// Lift suspension on approval
await _moderationModule.UnsuspendUserAsync(userId, "AI Appeal System");
```

### With ISpeechModule (ASHATAI)

```csharp
// Analyze response
var analysis = await _speechModule.GenerateResponseAsync(analysisPrompt);

// Make decision
var aiResponse = await _speechModule.GenerateResponseAsync(decisionPrompt);
```

## Configuration

### Confidence Threshold

Default: 0.7 (70%)

Adjust in `SupportChatModule.cs`:

```csharp
decision.RequiresHumanReview = 
    decision.Outcome == AppealOutcome.EscalateToHuman ||
    decision.ConfidenceScore < 0.7; // Change this value
```

### Custom Questions

Modify `_appealQuestions` list:

```csharp
private static readonly List<string> _appealQuestions = new()
{
    "Your custom question 1",
    "Your custom question 2",
    // ...
};
```

## Data Models
