**File:** `SECURITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (935 lines)

Detailed implementation guidance for EVERY identified gap:

- **Rate Limiting:** Code examples using AspNetCoreRateLimit package
- **Account Lockout:** Implementation for authentication module (5 attempts = 15 min lockout)
- **Log Rotation:** Serilog configuration with size limits and retention
- **Session Cleanup:** Background service for expired session removal

---

### 3. Incident Response Plan
**File:** `INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md` (692 lines)

A comprehensive incident response plan including:

- **Incident Classification:** P0 (Critical) ‚Üí P3 (Low) with response times
- **Detection Methods:** Automated monitoring, scanning, manual reporting
- **Triage Process:** 15-minute response for P0 incidents
- **Containment Procedures:** Isolate systems, preserve evidence, revoke access
- **Investigation Checklist:** Log analysis, database checks, evidence collection
- **Remediation Actions:** Fix development, testing, deployment procedures
- **Recovery Steps:** System integrity checks, data validation
- **Post-Incident Review:** Blameless post-mortem template
- **Contacts & Escalation:** 4-level escalation path
- **Communication Templates:** Internal alerts, status updates, customer notifications

---

### 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

Automated security scanning that runs on:
- Every push to main, release/*, or copilot/* branches
- Every pull request to main
- Weekly schedule (Sundays at 2 AM UTC)
- Manual trigger

**Jobs:**
1. **Build & Test** - Verify clean build and run tests
2. **Dependency Scan** - Check for vulnerable NuGet packages
3. **CodeQL Analysis** - Static code analysis for security issues
4. **Secret Scan** - Detect exposed credentials using Gitleaks
5. **Security Audit Summary** - Aggregate results and generate report

All results uploaded as artifacts for review.

---

### 5. CODEOWNERS File
**File:** `.github/CODEOWNERS`

Defines required reviewers for security-sensitive files:

- All files default to @buffbot88
- Security docs require security team approval
- Authentication modules require security review
- CI/CD workflows require devops approval
- Configuration files require owner approval
- API endpoints require owner approval

**Note:** Repository settings must enable "Require review from Code Owners" for this to be enforced.

---

### 6. Documentation Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `PRODUCTION_RELEASE_CHECKLIST_940.md` - Added security gate reference and expanded hardening checklist
- `README.md` - Added security badge and security documentation section
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Added comprehensive security section with feature list

**New Documentation Structure:**
