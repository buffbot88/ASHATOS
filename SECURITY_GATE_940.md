3. Implement log rotation and data retention policies
4. Create incident response documentation
5. Configure branch protection and CODEOWNERS
6. Enable HTTPS enforcement in production
7. Document production security hardening checklist

**Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours of engineering work

**Timeline:**
- Immediate (2-4 hours): CI/CD setup, documentation
- Short-term (4-8 hours): Rate limiting, log rotation
- Pre-release (4-8 hours): Branch protection, final testing
- Production (4-8 hours): HTTPS setup, monitoring

**Approval Contingent On:**
- [ ] All blocking items addressed
