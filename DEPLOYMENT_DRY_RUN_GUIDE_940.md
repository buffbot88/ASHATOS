## 🔄 Dry Run Procedure

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Environment Snapshot

```bash
# Take snapshot of current staging state
cd /home/runner/work/TheRaProject/TheRaProject

# Document current version
echo "=== Current Staging State ===" > dry_run_log.txt
date >> dry_run_log.txt
git --no-pager log -1 --oneline >> dry_run_log.txt

# Check current application status
dotnet --version >> dry_run_log.txt
ps aux | grep RaCore >> dry_run_log.txt
```

#### 1.2 Create Backup

```bash
# Create full backup before deployment
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/raos_v9.4.0_dryrun_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup application files
echo "Creating application backup..."
cp -r /opt/raos "$BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup"

# Backup database (SQLite example)
echo "Creating database backup..."
if [ -f "/opt/raos/data/raos.db" ]; then
    sqlite3 /opt/raos/data/raos.db ".backup '$BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup.db'"
    echo "✅ Database backup created: $BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup.db"
fi

# Backup configuration
echo "Backing up configuration..."
cp -r /opt/raos/config "$BACKUP_DIR/config_backup"

# Verify backup integrity
ls -lh "$BACKUP_DIR"
echo "✅ Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

#### 1.3 Health Check - Before

```bash
# Record baseline metrics
echo "=== Pre-Deployment Health Check ===" >> dry_run_log.txt

# Check disk space
df -h >> dry_run_log.txt

# Check memory usage
free -h >> dry_run_log.txt

# Check CPU load
uptime >> dry_run_log.txt

# Check application endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || echo "WARNING: Health endpoint failed"

# Test critical functionality
echo "Testing critical features..."
# Add application-specific health checks here
```

### Phase 2: Deployment (45 minutes)

#### 2.1 Stop Application

```bash
# Stop application gracefully
echo "Stopping application..."

# For systemd service
sudo systemctl stop racore.service
sudo systemctl status racore.service

# For manual process
# pkill -SIGTERM -f RaCore
# sleep 5
# pkill -9 -f RaCore

echo "✅ Application stopped"

else
    echo "❌ Build failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 2.3 Apply Configuration

```bash
# Update configuration for staging
echo "Applying configuration..."

# Set environment variables
export RACORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging
export RACORE_VERSION=9.4.0
export DATABASE_PATH=/opt/raos/data/raos.db

# Update appsettings if needed
# (In a real scenario, use environment-specific config)

echo "✅ Configuration applied"
```

#### 2.4 Database Migrations (if applicable)

```bash
# Apply any database migrations
echo "Checking for database migrations..."

# Example: dotnet ef database update
# cd RaCore
# dotnet ef database update --no-build

echo "✅ Database migrations complete (or none required)"
```

#### 2.5 Start Application

```bash
# Start application
echo "Starting application..."

# For systemd service
sudo systemctl start racore.service
sleep 10
sudo systemctl status racore.service

# Or manual start
# cd RaCore
# nohup dotnet bin/Release/net9.0/RaCore.dll &

echo "✅ Application started"
```

### Phase 3: Verification (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Health Check - After

```bash
# Wait for application to fully start
echo "Waiting for application startup..."
sleep 30

# Check application is running
ps aux | grep RaCore

# Test health endpoint
echo "Testing health endpoint..."
for i in {1..10}; do
    if curl -f http://localhost:5000/health; then
        echo "✅ Health check passed"
        break
    fi
    echo "Attempt $i failed, retrying..."
    sleep 5
done

# Check logs for errors
echo "Checking logs for errors..."
tail -100 /opt/raos/logs/raos.log | grep -i "error\|exception\|fail" || echo "No errors found"
```

#### 3.2 Functional Testing

```bash
# Test critical features
echo "=== Functional Testing ===" >> dry_run_log.txt

# Test 1: API endpoints
echo "Test 1: API Endpoints"

echo "Using backup: $BACKUP_DIR"

# Restore application files
rm -rf /opt/raos/*
cp -r "$BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup"/* /opt/raos/

# Restore database
if [ -f "$BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup.db" ]; then
    cp "$BACKUP_DIR/raos_backup.db" /opt/raos/data/raos.db
    echo "✅ Database restored"
fi

# Restore configuration

echo "Starting application after rollback..."
sudo systemctl start racore.service
sleep 15

# Verify application is running
curl -f http://localhost:5000/health && echo "✅ Rollback successful" || echo "❌ Rollback failed"

# Check version (should be previous version)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/version

# Verify data integrity
# (Application-specific data checks)

echo "✅ Rollback verification completed"
```

#### 4.3 Re-deploy v9.4.0

```bash
# After verifying rollback works, re-deploy v9.4.0
echo "Re-deploying v9.4.0 after successful rollback test..."

# Repeat deployment steps from Phase 2
# (Abbreviated version - use same commands as above)

sudo systemctl stop racore.service
cd /opt/raos
git checkout v9.4.0
./build-linux-production.sh
sudo systemctl start racore.service
sleep 15

# Verify final deployment
curl -f http://localhost:5000/health && echo "✅ Final deployment successful"

echo "✅ Dry run completed successfully"
```

## 🚨 Issue Resolution

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Application fails to start
**Solution:**
- Check logs: `tail -100 /opt/raos/logs/raos.log`
- Verify permissions: `ls -la /opt/raos`
- Check port availability: `netstat -tlnp | grep 5000`
- Review configuration: `cat /opt/raos/config/appsettings.json`

#### Issue: Database connection fails
**Solution:**
- Verify database file exists: `ls -la /opt/raos/data/raos.db`
- Check permissions: `chmod 644 /opt/raos/data/raos.db`
- Verify connection string in configuration
- Test SQLite connectivity: `sqlite3 /opt/raos/data/raos.db "SELECT 1;"`

#### Issue: Health check timeouts
**Solution:**
- Increase startup wait time (application may need more time)
- Check if application is actually running: `ps aux | grep RaCore`
- Review firewall rules: `sudo iptables -L`
- Check application logs for startup errors

#### Issue: Rollback data loss
**Solution:**
- This should not happen if backups are taken before deployment
- Verify backup was created: `ls -la $BACKUP_DIR`
- Always test backup integrity before deployment
- Consider implementing database transaction logs
