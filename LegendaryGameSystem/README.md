# Legendary Game System

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Phase:** 9  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

## Overview

The **Legendary Game System** is a production-ready, unified modular DLL package that consolidates the complete game infrastructure for ASHATOS. It combines three previously separate systems into one cohesive module:

- **Game Engine** - Scene management, entities, physics, and AI
- **Game Server** - AI-driven game creation and deployment
- **Game Client** - Multi-platform client generation (WebGL, Desktop)

Inspired by Unreal Engine architecture, this unified system provides enterprise-grade features including in-game chat, advanced physics, AI behaviors, and multiplayer synchronization.

## Key Features

### 🎮 Core Game Engine
- **Scene Management** - Create, update, delete game worlds/levels/areas
- **Entity System** - Hierarchical entity management with 3D transforms
- **AI-Driven Generation** - Natural language world and content generation
- **Asset Streaming** - Dynamic asset loading and management
- **WebSocket Broadcasting** - Real-time event updates to all clients
- **SQLite Persistence** - Scenes and entities persist across restarts

### 🖥️ Game Server System
- **AI-Driven Game Creation** - Generate complete games from natural language descriptions
- **Automatic Code Generation** - Front-end and back-end code generation
- **Asset Creation** - AI-powered asset generation
- **One-Click Deployment** - Deploy game servers with single command
- **Real-Time Preview** - Live preview and iteration support

### 🎯 Game Client System
- **Multi-Platform Support** - WebGL, Windows, Linux, macOS clients
- **HTML5/WebGL Clients** - Browser-based game clients
- **License Integration** - Per-user license key validation
- **Automatic Client Generation** - Generate clients from server configuration

### ⭐ Additional Features (Phase 9)
- **In-Game Chat System** - Separate chat rooms for each game scene
  - Independent from website CMS chat
  - Scene-specific chat rooms
  - Real-time messaging within games
  - Participant tracking
  - Message history (last 200 messages per room)
- **Advanced Architecture** - Modular DLL design for hot-swapping
- **Plugin System Ready** - Extension points for custom game logic
- **Multiplayer Foundation** - Infrastructure for player synchronization

## In-Game Chat System

The in-game chat system is completely sepaRate from the CMS website chat system (`ChatModule`). Each game scene can have multiple chat rooms for different purposes (party chat, guild chat, zone chat, etc.).

### Chat Features
- **Scene-Based Rooms** - Each chat room is tied to a specific game scene
- **Message History** - Maintains last 200 messages per room
- **Participant tracking** - TASHATck active players in each room
- **Room Management** - Create, close, and manage chat rooms
- **Real-time Updates** - Instant message delivery to participants

### Example Usage

```csharp
// Create an in-game chat room for a scene
var (success, message, roomId) = await engine.CreateInGameChatRoomAsync(
    sceneId: "dungeon_001",
    roomName: "Party Chat",
    createdBy: "player123"
);

// Send a message to the room
await engine.SendInGameChatMessageAsync(
    roomId: roomId,
    userId: "player123",
    username: "WarriorKing",
    content: "Let's attack the boss!"
);

// Get recent messages
var messages = await engine.GetInGameChatMessagesAsync(roomId, limit: 50);

// Get all chat rooms for a scene
var rooms = await engine.GetInGameChatRoomsForSceneAsync("dungeon_001");
```

## Module Loading

The Legendary Game Engine is loaded as a hot-swappable DLL module by ASHATCore's ModuleManager:

1. **Build** - The LegendaryGameEngine.dll is built as a sepaRate class libASHATry
2. **Copy** - DLL is copied to ASHATCore's output directory via project reference
3. **Load** - ModuleManager discovers and loads the module at runtime
4. **Update** - Can be updated independently without rebuilding ASHATCore mainframe

## Comparison: CMS Chat vs In-Game Chat

| Feature | CMS Website Chat | In-Game Chat |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Location** | LegendaryCMS module | LegendaryGameEngine module |
| **Purpose** | Website forums, support | Game instance communication |
| **Scope** | Global, persistent | Scene-specific, temporary |
| **Persistence** | Long-term database | Short-term memory (200 msgs) |
| **Use Cases** | General discussion, support tickets | Party chat, guild chat, zone chat |
| **moderation** | Content moderation Intergrated | Game-specific moderation |

## Benefits of Modular DLL Approach

Following Phase 8's successful LegendaryCMS Extraction pattern:

1. **Independent Updates** - Update game engine without touching ASHATCore core
2. **Hot Reload Capability** - Swap DLL at runtime for live updates
3. **Isolated Development** - Work on game features independently
4. **Version Control** - SepaRate versioning for game engine vs core
5. **Deployment Flexibility** - Deploy game engine updates sepaRately
6. **Reduced Coupling** - Clean sepaASHATtion between mainframe and game logic

## API integration

The Legendary Game Engine integRates with ASHATCore's REST API endpoints (defined in `ASHATCore/Program.cs`):

### Scene Operations
