### Partially Implemented Features ⚠️
1. ⚠️ Forum functionality (UI exists, needs backend implementation)
2. ⚠️ User profiles (basic implementation, needs social features)
3. ⚠️ Admin panel (UI exists, needs full management features)
4. ⚠️ Learning modules (placeholder)
5. ⚠️ Downloads (placeholder)

## Known Limitations

1. Password hashing uses basic SHA256 (should use BCrypt or Argon2 in production)
2. No email verification
3. No password reset functionality
4. No CSRF tokens (should add in production)
5. Forum posting not yet implemented in backend
6. Profile timeline/friends features not yet implemented
7. File upload functionality not implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Port Already in Use
**Solution:** Change port in `appsettings.json` or use:
```bash
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5555"
```

### Issue: Database Locked
**Solution:** Ensure no other process is accessing the database file. Stop all instances of the application.

### Issue: Session Not Persisting
**Solution:** Check that cookies are enabled in your browser.

### Issue: Can't Create Admin Account
**Solution:** Delete the database file and restart the application to trigger first-run setup.
