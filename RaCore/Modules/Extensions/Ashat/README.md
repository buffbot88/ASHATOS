# Ashat AI Coding Assistant

> **Ashat** (pronounced AH-SH-AHT) is the "Face" of RaOS - your intelligent AI coding companion for development assistance, guidance, and learning.

## 🌟 Overview

Ashat is an AI-powered coding assistant that works **with** you, not **for** you. She follows an approval-based workflow, ensuring you maintain full control over your code while receiving intelligent guidance and assistance.

### Key Principles

1. **Interactive Collaboration** - Ashat forms action plans and discusses approaches with you
2. **Approval-Based Workflow** - No code changes without your explicit approval
3. **Educational Focus** - Helps you understand the "why" behind solutions
4. **Module Integration** - Deep knowledge of all RaOS modules and their capabilities
5. **Context-Aware** - Provides relevant suggestions based on your goals

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. Interactive Coding Sessions

Start a guided session where Ashat helps you achieve your development goals:

```
ashat start session dev001 Create a new inventory tracking module
```

Ashat will:
- Understand your requirements
- Identify relevant modules
- Create an action plan
- Guide you through implementation

### 2. Module Knowledge Base

Ashat maintains knowledge of all RaOS modules:

```
ashat modules                    # List all modules
ashat module info AICodeGen      # Get detailed module info
```

### 3. Approval-Based Workflow

Ashat follows a strict workflow to ensure you're in control:

```
1. Form Action Plan
   ↓
2. Request Approval
   ↓
3. If Approved → Continue
4. If Not Approved → Ask for Direction → Revise Plan
```

### 4. Contextual Q&A
