```

## Technical Implementation

### Standard Exchange Ratio Enforcement

The system enforces the 10:1,000 ratio at all exchange points:

```csharp
// Example: Exchanging 10 RaCoin
var goldAmount = CurrencyExchangeConstants.RaCoinToGold(10m);
// Result: 1,000 Gold

// Example: Exchanging 1,000 Gold
var racoinAmount = CurrencyExchangeConstants.GoldToRaCoin(1000m);
// Result: 10 RaCoin
```

### Market Monitoring Flow

1. **Transaction Initiated**: User requests currency exchange
2. **Validation**: RaCoin module validates balances
3. **Exchange Execution**: Currencies are exchanged at standard rate
4. **Recording**: Transaction recorded in both modules
5. **Monitoring**: Market monitor analyzes transaction
6. **Alert Generation**: If thresholds exceeded, alert is created
7. **Response**: User receives exchange confirmation

### Alert System

The system generates alerts for:
- **Unusual Volume**: High-volume exchanges in short time
- **Rate Deviation**: Attempts to use non-standard rates (blocked)
- **Large Transactions**: Individual exchanges over 100k RaCoin
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Coordinated or repetitive behavior

### Principle Enforcement: "Harm None, Do What Ye Will"

The system actively prevents:
- **Market Manipulation**: Detects coordinated attacks
- **Exploitative Trading**: Flags suspicious patterns
- **Unfair Advantages**: Enforces universal rate
- **Economic Imbalance**: Monitors total circulation

## Usage Examples

### Player Exchange (RaCoin to Gold)
```bash
# Player has 500 RaCoin, wants to exchange 10 for Gold
racoin exchange racoin-to-gold <user-id> 10

# Result:
# - RaCoin balance: 500 → 490
# - Gold balance: 0 → 1,000
# - Exchange rate: 100 Gold per RaCoin
# - Transaction recorded
# - Market monitor notified
```

### Player Exchange (Gold to RaCoin)
```bash
# Player has 5,000 Gold, wants to exchange 1,000 for RaCoin
racoin exchange gold-to-racoin <user-id> 1000

# Result:
# - Gold balance: 5,000 → 4,000
# - RaCoin balance: 0 → 10
# - Exchange rate: 0.01 RaCoin per Gold
# - Transaction recorded
# - Market monitor notified
```

### Administrator Market Review
```bash
# Check overall market health
market analyze

# Output includes:
# - Standard exchange rate confirmation
# - Recent activity (last hour)
# - Active alert count by severity
# - Overall health status (HEALTHY/CAUTION/WARNING/CRITICAL)
# - Principle enforcement verification
```

### View Exchange Rates
```bash
racoin exchange rates

# Shows:
# - Standard rate: 1000 RaCoin = 400,000 Gold
# - Per-unit rates
# - System circulation totals
# - Example conversions
```

## Game Developer Integration

### In-Game Shop Example
```csharp
// Player wants to buy an item that costs 1,000,000 Gold
var itemPrice = 1000000m;
var goldBalance = racoinModule.GetGoldBalance(playerId);

if (goldBalance < itemPrice)
{
    var goldNeeded = itemPrice - goldBalance;
    var racoinNeeded = CurrencyExchangeConstants.GoldToRaCoin(goldNeeded);
    
    // Inform player of exchange requirement
    Console.WriteLine($"Need {goldNeeded} more Gold");
    Console.WriteLine($"Exchange {racoinNeeded} RaCoin to continue");
    
    // Perform exchange
    var result = await racoinModule.ExchangeRaCoinToGoldAsync(playerId, racoinNeeded);
    
    if (result.Success)
    {
        // Deduct gold and complete purchase
        goldBalance = result.NewGoldBalance.Value;
        // ... process purchase
    }
}
```

### Quest Reward Example
```csharp
// Quest rewards player with Gold
var quest = new Quest
{
    Name = "Dragon Slayer",
    Rewards = new List<QuestReward>
    {
        new() { RewardType = "Gold", Value = 500000 },
        new() { RewardType = "Experience", Value = 1000 }
    }
};

// When quest completes, add Gold to player's wallet
foreach (var reward in quest.Rewards)
{
    if (reward.RewardType == "Gold")
    {
        var goldWallet = racoinModule.GetOrCreateGoldWallet(playerId);
        goldWallet.Balance += reward.Value;
        
        // Optionally inform player they can exchange to RaCoin
        var equivalentRaCoin = CurrencyExchangeConstants.GoldToRaCoin(reward.Value);
        Console.WriteLine($"Earned {reward.Value} Gold (≈ {equivalentRaCoin} RaCoin)");
    }
}
```

### NPC Merchant Example
```csharp
// NPC shop accepts both Gold and RaCoin
public class MerchantShop
{
    public async Task<bool> PurchaseItem(Guid playerId, decimal goldPrice)
    {
        // Check if player has enough Gold
        var goldBalance = racoinModule.GetGoldBalance(playerId);
        
        if (goldBalance >= goldPrice)
        {
            // Direct Gold payment
            return DeductGold(playerId, goldPrice);
        }
        else
        {
            // Offer RaCoin conversion
            var racoinEquivalent = CurrencyExchangeConstants.GoldToRaCoin(goldPrice);
            Console.WriteLine($"Insufficient Gold. You can pay {racoinEquivalent} RaCoin instead.");
            
            // Player chooses to pay with RaCoin
            var racoinBalance = racoinModule.GetBalance(playerId);
            if (racoinBalance >= racoinEquivalent)
            {
                var result = await racoinModule.DeductAsync(playerId, racoinEquivalent, 
                    $"Purchase from merchant (converted from {goldPrice} Gold)");
                return result.Success;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Market Health Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
The system continuously monitors:
1. **Transaction Volume**: Tracks 24-hour volume
2. **Exchange Frequency**: Monitors rapid exchanges
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies suspicious behavior
4. **Balance Tracking**: Ensures economic stability

### Alert Response
When alerts are generated:
1. **Logged to Console**: Real-time notification
2. **Stored in System**: Available for review
3. **Admin Notification**: Can be routed to administrators
4. **Automatic Analysis**: Contributes to market health status

### Health Status Determination
- **HEALTHY**: No alerts, normal activity
- **CAUTION**: Minor alerts present, monitoring continues
- **WARNING**: High-severity alerts, review recommended
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate intervention may be needed

## Configuration & Customization

### Adjusting Monitoring Thresholds

Edit `MarketMonitorModule.cs`:
```csharp
// Change maximum allowed deviation
private const decimal MaxDeviationPercentage = 5.0m; // 5%

// Change large transaction threshold
private const decimal LargeTransactionThreshold = 100000m; // 100k RaCoin

// Change suspicious volume monitoring
private const int SuspiciousVolumeWindow = 60; // seconds
private const decimal SuspiciousVolumeThreshold = 500000m; // 500k RaCoin
```

### Changing Exchange Rate (Not Recommended)

If changing the universal ratio is absolutely necessary:
```csharp
// Edit CurrencyExchangeConstants.cs
public const decimal StandardRaCoinAmount = 1000m;
public const decimal StandardGoldAmount = 400000m; // Change this
```

**Warning**: Changing the standard rate affects all games and should only be done with careful consideration.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create Test User**:
   ```bash
   # Create or identify a test user ID
   ```

2. **Add RaCoin Balance**:
   ```bash
   racoin topup <user-id> 10000
   ```

3. **Check Balances**:
   ```bash
   racoin balance <user-id>
   racoin gold balance <user-id>
   ```

4. **Test Exchange (RaCoin to Gold)**:
   ```bash
   racoin exchange racoin-to-gold <user-id> 1000
   # Should deduct 1000 RaCoin, add 400,000 Gold
   ```

5. **Verify Balances**:
   ```bash
   racoin balance <user-id>
   racoin gold balance <user-id>
   ```

6. **Test Exchange (Gold to RaCoin)**:
   ```bash
   racoin exchange gold-to-racoin <user-id> 400000
   # Should deduct 400,000 Gold, add 1000 RaCoin
   ```

7. **Check Market Monitor**:
   ```bash
   market stats
   market alerts
   market analyze
   ```

8. **Test Large Transaction Alert**:
   ```bash
   racoin topup <user-id> 200000
   racoin exchange racoin-to-gold <user-id> 150000
   market alerts
   # Should show alert for large transaction
   ```
