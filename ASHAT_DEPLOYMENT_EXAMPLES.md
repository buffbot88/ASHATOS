# ASHAT Deployment Workflow - Quick Start Examples

This guide provides practical examples for using the ASHAT Deployment Workflow Module.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Example 1: First Time Setup

```bash
# Step 1: Configure your servers (one-time setup)
deploy configure public http://staging.mycompany.com PublicStaging
deploy configure omega https://omega.mycompany.com OmegaProduction

# Step 2: Verify configuration
deploy servers

# Expected output:
# [ALPHA] ALPHA Development
#   URL: http://localhost:5000
#   Status: ‚úÖ Configured
#
# [PUBLIC] PublicStaging
#   URL: http://staging.mycompany.com
#   Status: ‚úÖ Configured
#
# [OMEGA] OmegaProduction
#   URL: https://omega.mycompany.com
#   Status: ‚úÖ Configured
```

### Example 2: Deploy a Hotfix

```bash
# Scenario: Critical security vulnerability discovered
# Need to deploy a hotfix quickly but safely

# Step 1: Push hotfix to staging
deploy push hotfix-security-2024-01 'Fix critical auth bypass vulnerability' 'Patches CVE-2024-12345'

# Output shows deployment plan:
# üöÄ ASHAT Deployment Workflow Initiated
# 
# Update ID: hotfix-security-2024-01
# Description: Fix critical auth bypass vulnerability
# Target: PublicStaging (http://staging.mycompany.com)
# 
# üìã Deployment Plan:
#   1. Commit and Package
#   2. Deploy to Public Server
#   3. Verification Tests
#   4. Await Approval ‚ö†Ô∏è [APPROVAL REQUIRED]

# Step 2: Run verification
deploy verify hotfix-security-2024-01

# Output shows verification results:
# üîç ASHAT Deployment Verification
# 
# Running verification tests on Public Server...
# 
# ‚úÖ Health Check: Server responding normally
# ‚úÖ Module Load Test: All modules loaded successfully
# ‚úÖ API Endpoint Test: All endpoints responding
# ‚úÖ Database Connection: Database connectivity verified
# ‚úÖ Performance Baseline: Performance within acceptable range
# ‚úÖ Security Scan: No security vulnerabilities detected
# 
# ‚úÖ Verification PASSED!

# Step 3: Approve for production
deploy approve hotfix-security-2024-01

# Output confirms deployment:
# üéâ ASHAT Deployment to OMEGA Approved!
# 
# Deploying to: OmegaProduction (https://omega.mycompany.com)
# 
# üì§ Deployment Process:
#   1. ‚úÖ Packaging approved update
#   2. ‚úÖ Pushing to OMEGA server
#   3. ‚úÖ OMEGA receiving update package
#   4. ‚úÖ Distributing to Licensed Mainframes
# 
# ‚úÖ Deployment completed successfully!
```

### Example 3: Deploy a Feature Update

```bash
# Scenario: New analytics dashboard feature
# Standard feature deployment workflow

# Step 1: Push feature to staging
deploy push feature-analytics-v2 'New analytics dashboard with real-time metrics'

# Step 2: Verify on staging
deploy verify feature-analytics-v2

# Step 3: Manual testing on staging server
# (Use web browser to test http://staging.mycompany.com)
# Test all dashboard features, verify metrics are accurate

# Step 4: If everything looks good, approve
deploy approve feature-analytics-v2

# Step 5: Monitor production
# Check OMEGA server logs and metrics
# Verify feature is working as expected
```

### Example 4: Rollback a Failed Deployment

```bash
# Scenario: Deployment passed verification but causes issues in production
# Need to rollback immediately

# Step 1: Check current deployment status
deploy status

# Output:
# üìä ASHAT Deployment Status
# Active Deployments: 1
#   ‚Ä¢ feature-payment-v3:
#     Status: Completed
#     Stage: DeployingToOmega
#     Created: 2024-01-15 10:30:00

# Step 2: Rollback the deployment
deploy rollback feature-payment-v3

# Output:
# ‚è™ Deployment 'feature-payment-v3' rolled back successfully.
# Public Server reverted to previous state.
# No changes were pushed to OMEGA.

# Step 3: Investigate and fix issues
# Review logs, fix code, prepare new deployment
deploy push feature-payment-v3-fixed 'Payment feature (fixed critical bug)'
deploy verify feature-payment-v3-fixed
deploy approve feature-payment-v3-fixed
```

### Example 5: Managing Multiple Deployments

```bash
# Scenario: Multiple teams working on different features
# Deploy and track multiple updates simultaneously

# Team 1: Backend API updates
deploy push api-update-q1 'REST API v2.0 with GraphQL support'

# Team 2: Frontend UI refresh
deploy push ui-refresh-2024 'Modernized user interface'

# Team 3: Database optimizations
deploy push db-optimize-001 'Query optimization and indexing'

# Check status of all deployments
deploy status

# Output:
# üìä ASHAT Deployment Status
# Active Deployments: 3
#   ‚Ä¢ api-update-q1: Status: Pending, Stage: Planning
#   ‚Ä¢ ui-refresh-2024: Status: Pending, Stage: Planning
#   ‚Ä¢ db-optimize-001: Status: Pending, Stage: Planning

# Verify each independently
deploy verify api-update-q1
deploy verify ui-refresh-2024
deploy verify db-optimize-q1

# Approve in priority order
deploy approve db-optimize-001      # High priority
deploy approve api-update-q1        # Medium priority
deploy approve ui-refresh-2024      # Low priority
```

### Example 6: Scheduled Maintenance Deployment

```bash
# Scenario: Scheduled maintenance window for major updates
# Deploy multiple related updates in sequence

# Before maintenance window - prepare all updates
deploy push maintenance-db-migration 'Database schema v3.0 migration'
deploy push maintenance-module-update 'Core module updates'
deploy push maintenance-security-patch 'Security patches'

# During maintenance window - execute in order
# Step 1: Database migration
deploy verify maintenance-db-migration
deploy approve maintenance-db-migration

# Wait for database migration to complete
# Check OMEGA logs

# Step 2: Module updates
deploy verify maintenance-module-update
deploy approve maintenance-module-update

# Step 3: Security patches
deploy verify maintenance-security-patch
deploy approve maintenance-security-patch

# After maintenance window - verify everything
deploy history

# Output shows complete audit trail:
# üìú Deployment History
# Total Deployments: 3
# 
# Update: maintenance-security-patch
#   Deployed: 2024-01-15 03:45:00
#   Verification: ‚úÖ Passed
# 
# Update: maintenance-module-update
#   Deployed: 2024-01-15 03:30:00
#   Verification: ‚úÖ Passed
# 
# Update: maintenance-db-migration
#   Deployed: 2024-01-15 03:15:00
#   Verification: ‚úÖ Passed
```

### Example 7: Emergency Deployment (Skip Staging)

```bash
# WARNING: Only for extreme emergencies!
# Scenario: Production is completely down, need immediate fix
# This example shows the process, but ALWAYS verify if possible

# Step 1: Push directly to public server
deploy push emergency-fix-001 'Critical system recovery patch' 'EMERGENCY: Production down'

# Step 2: Minimal verification (still recommended!)
deploy verify emergency-fix-001

# Step 3: Immediate approval if verification passes
deploy approve emergency-fix-001

# Best practice: Even in emergencies, follow the workflow
# The automated verification takes only minutes and can prevent
# making a bad situation worse
```

### Example 8: Testing Without Deploying to OMEGA

```bash
# Scenario: Want to test deployment process without affecting production
# Use this for training or testing the workflow

# Step 1: Don't configure OMEGA server (or configure a test OMEGA)
deploy servers

# If OMEGA is not configured, you'll see:
# [OMEGA] OMEGA Live Server
#   Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Configured

# Step 2: Push and verify as normal
deploy push test-deployment-001 'Testing deployment workflow'
deploy verify test-deployment-001

# Step 3: Try to approve (will show warning)
deploy approve test-deployment-001

# Output:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: OMEGA Server not configured.
# In production, this would push to the live OMEGA server.
# Use 'deploy configure omega <url> <name>' to configure it.

# This allows safe testing of the deployment workflow
```

## üìä Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Deployment Status

```bash
# View active deployments
deploy status

# View deployment history
deploy history

# List configured servers
deploy servers
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Get help
deploy help

# Configure servers
deploy configure public <url> <name>
deploy configure omega <url> <name>

# Deployment lifecycle
deploy push <id> <description>
deploy verify <id>
deploy approve <id>
deploy rollback <id>
deploy cancel <id>
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always verify before approving**
   - Never skip the verification step
   - Review verification results carefully
   - Test manually on staging if needed

2. **Use descriptive IDs**
   - Good: `security-patch-2024-01`, `feature-analytics-v2`
   - Bad: `update1`, `fix`, `test`

3. **Include detailed descriptions**
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - Any special considerations

4. **Monitor after deployment**
   - Check OMEGA server logs
   - Verify functionality
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Be ready to rollback if needed

5. **Keep deployment history**
   - Use `deploy history` to review past deployments
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Learn from previous deployments

## üîí Security Reminders

- All deployments require explicit approval
- Verification checks include security scans
- OMEGA server credentials should be protected
- Use HTTPS for all server URLs
- Limit deployment permissions to authorized personnel

## üìû Getting Help

```bash
# Built-in help
