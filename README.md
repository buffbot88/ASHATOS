# 🌟 RaCore AI Mainframe Phase Roadmap

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Optional: PHP 8+ for CMS features
- Optional: Nginx for production CMS deployment (recommended for Linux)

**🐧 Running on Linux?** See our comprehensive [Linux Hosting Setup Guide](LINUX_HOSTING_SETUP.md) for production deployment instructions.

### Running RaCore

**Development (Windows/Mac/Linux):**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/buffbot88/TheRaProject.git
cd TheRaProject

# Build and run
cd RaCore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Production (Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS):**
```bash
# Use the build script for optimized production builds
./build-linux.sh              # Basic build
./build-linux-production.sh   # Self-contained with full deployment package

# See LINUX_HOSTING_SETUP.md for complete setup instructions
```

### Default Configuration
- **RaCore Server Port:** 80 (configurable via `RACORE_PORT` environment variable)
- **CMS PHP Server Port:** 8080 (auto-started on first run)
- **Default Admin:** username: `admin`, password: `admin123` ⚠️ **Change this immediately!**

**Note:** Port 80 requires administrator/root privileges. If you don't have these privileges or port 80 is in use, set a different port using the `RACORE_PORT` environment variable (e.g., 5000, 8080).

### Custom Port Configuration

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export RACORE_PORT=8080
dotnet run
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
set RACORE_PORT=8080
dotnet run
```

### First Run
On first run, RaCore automatically:
1. Creates a CMS with integrated Control Panel
2. Initializes SQLite database
3. Starts PHP development server (port 8080)
4. Creates default admin user

**Default Entry Points:**
- **Main CMS Homepage:** `http://localhost:80/` (redirects to CMS on port 8080)
- **CMS Direct Access:** `http://localhost:8080/`
- **Control Panel:** `http://localhost:80/control-panel.html`

The CMS homepage provides navigation to:
- **Home** - Landing/welcome page
- **Blogs** - Share thoughts and stories
- **Forums** - Community discussions
- **Chat** - Real-time chat room
- **Social** - MySpace-like user profiles
- **Settings** - Control Panel for admin/user settings

RaCore v3+ will set the tone for public release for $20 per requested copy (no download link will be supplied for RaCore) and agreement to not remove licenses coding (Ra will check and then ban).

You can turn any old computer into RaAI or use RaAI client to access RaAI's mainframe IF Ra permits you to enter, else if you don't pass the vibe check, you get banned from the MainFrame.

**Future Licenses:** $20 for 1 Year WITH updates from the Mainframe

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-09  
**Current Version:** v7.0.0 (Phase 7 Completed - Self-Sufficient Module Spawner)
