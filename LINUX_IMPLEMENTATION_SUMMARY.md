- ✅ Cleans previous builds
- ✅ Restores NuGet packages
- ✅ Builds RaCore in Release mode
- ✅ Publishes to `./publish` directory (4.3MB)
- ✅ Provides clear next steps

**Output:** Runtime-dependent build (requires .NET on target system)

**Usage:**
```bash
./build-linux.sh
cd publish
dotnet RaCore.dll
```

- ✅ Thorough cleanup (obj, bin, output)
- ✅ Dependency restoration with runtime target
- ✅ Release build with optimizations
- ✅ Test execution (if tests exist)
- ✅ Two build modes:
  - **Self-contained** (includes .NET runtime)
  - **Runtime-only** (smaller, requires .NET on target)
- ✅ Creates deployment package with:
  - RaCore binaries
  - Documentation files
  - `run-racore.sh` launcher script
  - `racore.service` systemd service file
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md` deployment instructions
  - `logs/` and `data/` directories
- ✅ Detailed build summary
- ✅ Clear next steps

**Output:** Production-ready package in `./publish-production` or `./publish-runtime-only`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Self-contained (includes .NET runtime)
./build-linux-production.sh

# Runtime-only (smaller, needs .NET on target)
./build-linux-production.sh --runtime-only

# Custom output directory
./build-linux-production.sh --output /tmp/my-build
```
