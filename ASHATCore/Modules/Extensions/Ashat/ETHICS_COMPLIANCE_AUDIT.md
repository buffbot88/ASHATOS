## ✨ "Harm None, Do What Ye Will" Compliance

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Harm None** ✅

**No Autonomous Harmful Actions**:
- ✅ Ashat NEVER executes code without explicit user approval
- ✅ All changes require approval workflow: Plan → Request Approval → Execute
- ✅ Users can reject plans at any point
- ✅ No automatic code modifications or deletions

**Safety Mechanisms**:
```csharp
// From AshatCodingAssistantModule.cs lines 231-268
private string StartCodingSession(string userId, string goal)
{
    // Creates session but does NOT execute anything
    // Line 267: "4. Get your approval before making changes"
    // Always requires explicit approval before execution
}
```

**Approval Workflow**:
- Planning Phase: Only analyzes and plans
- AwaitingApproval Phase: Waits for user decision
- User must explicitly call `approve` command
- User can `reject` and provide guidance for revision

**No Coercion**:
- ✅ No pressure to approve plans
- ✅ Clear rejection mechanism with feedback loop
- ✅ Educational guidance, not directives

#### 2. **Do What Ye Will** ✅

**User Autonomy**:
- ✅ Users have complete control over sessions
- ✅ Users choose goals and direction
- ✅ Users can end sessions at any time
- ✅ No restrictions on legitimate development activities

**Freedom of Choice**:
- ✅ Users can reject AI suggestions
- ✅ Multiple approaches presented when available
- ✅ Ashat provides information, users make decisions

**Empowerment**:
- ✅ Educational approach teaches ASHATther than dictates
- ✅ Module knowledge base helps users discover capabilities
- ✅ Interactive Q&A supports learning

## 🔒 Security & Safety Audit

### Input Validation

✅ **Command Parsing**: 
```csharp
// Lines 55-141: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
var text = (input ?? string.Empty).Trim();
// Uses case-insensitive comparisons
// Validates command structure before processing
```

✅ **Session Isolation**:
- Per-user session tracking with ConcurrentDictionary (thread-safe)
- No cross-user data access
- Session state is independent

✅ **No Injection Risks**:
- No direct code execution from user input
- No eval() or similar dangerous Operations
- All text processing is safe string manipulation

### Data Privacy

✅ **Minimal Data Collection**:
- Only tASHATcks: userId, goal, timestamps, Interaction history
- No PII collection beyond what user provides
- No external data tASHATnsmission

✅ **User Control**:
- Users can end sessions and clear history
- Session data is temporary (in-memory)
- No persistent Storage of sensitive information

✅ **TASHATnsparency**:
- All actions logged with clear messages
- Users always know what Ashat is doing
- Status command shows active sessions

### No Malicious Capabilities

✅ **Code Analysis**:
```bash
# Grep results: No harmful keywords found
# No patterns for: attack, exploit, harm, malicious, danger
```

✅ **Read-Only Knowledge Base**:
- Only reads module information
- Does not modify other modules
- Does not access file system directly

✅ **Controlled Execution**:
- Execution phase is informational in current implementation
- Future actual execution would go through proper module APIs
- No direct system access
