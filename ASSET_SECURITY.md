# Asset Security Module - RaOS Phase 9.3.6

## Overview
The Asset Security Module provides comprehensive watermark detection and ownership verification for federated assets in RaOS. It ensures server and intellectual property integrity by scanning all incoming assets for watermarks, copyright information, and embedded identifiers before allowing import.

## Features

### Deep Watermark Scanning
- **Metadata Analysis**: Scans asset metadata for copyright, creator, author, owner, license, and rights information
- **Binary Data Inspection**: Examines binary data for embedded watermarks and file signatures (EXIF, JPEG markers, etc.)
- **Text Pattern Recognition**: Detects known brand names, trademarks, and copyright symbols (©, ™, ®) in filenames and descriptions
- **Multi-Level Detection**: Identifies watermarks with confidence scoring (0.0 to 1.0)

### Ownership Verification
- **Automated Verification**: Determines if assets appear to be custom/original work or contain third-party watermarks
- **Proof of Ownership Workflow**: Requires explicit proof when watermarks are detected
- **Status Tracking**: Categorizes assets as Verified, Unverified, RequiresProof, Blocked, or Custom
- **Verification Methods**: Documents how ownership was verified (watermark detection, manual verification, etc.)

### Secure Asset Import
- **Pre-Import Security Checks**: All assets undergo watermark scanning and ownership verification before import
- **Import Blocking**: Assets failing verification are automatically blocked with detailed logging
- **Local Storage**: All imported assets are stored locally with clear attribution
- **Attribution Tracking**: Maintains detailed metadata for each imported asset including scan results and ownership information

### Security Logging
- **Blocked Assets Log**: Maintains a log of all blocked asset imports with timestamps and reasons
- **Attribution Files**: Creates JSON metadata files for each imported asset documenting security checks
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of watermark scans and ownership verification attempts

### Programmatic API

#### Scan for Watermarks
```csharp
var assetSecurityModule = moduleManager.GetModule<AssetSecurityModule>();
var asset = new AssetDefinition
{
    Name = "character_model.fbx",
    Description = "3D character model",
    AssetData = File.ReadAllBytes("character_model.fbx"),
    Properties = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "creator", "John Doe" },
        { "copyright", "2025 Example Corp" }
    }
};

var scanResult = await assetSecurityModule.ScanForWatermarksAsync(asset);
if (scanResult.HasWatermark)
{
    foreach (var watermark in scanResult.DetectedWatermarks)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found {watermark.Type}: {watermark.Content} ({watermark.Confidence * 100}% confidence)");
    }
}
```

#### Verify Ownership
```csharp
var ownerId = Guid.Parse("user-guid-here");
var verificationResult = await assetSecurityModule.VerifyOwnershipAsync(asset, ownerId);

if (verificationResult.IsVerified)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Ownership verified: {verificationResult.Details}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Verification failed: {verificationResult.Details}");
}
```

#### Import Asset with Security Checks
```csharp
var importResult = await assetSecurityModule.ImportAssetAsync(asset, ownerId, requireOwnershipProof: true);

if (importResult.Success)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Asset imported successfully!");
    Console.WriteLine($"Asset ID: {importResult.AssetId}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Storage Path: {importResult.LocalStoragePath}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Import blocked: {importResult.Message}");
}
```

## Security Requirements

### For Asset Imports
1. **All federated assets MUST undergo watermark scanning** before import
2. **Assets with detected watermarks REQUIRE proof of ownership** or explicit confirmation
3. **All imported assets MUST be stored locally** with attribution
4. **Blocked imports MUST be logged** with timestamp and reason

### For Federated Asset Handling
When receiving assets from federated sources:
1. Extract asset data and metadata
2. Call `ScanForWatermarksAsync()` to detect embedded identifiers
3. Call `VerifyOwnershipAsync()` to confirm ownership rights
4. If verification fails, call `BlockAssetImportAsync()` and reject the asset
5. If verification succeeds, call `ImportAssetAsync()` to store locally with attribution

## File Structure

### Asset Storage Directory
```
assets/
├── {ownerId}_{assetId}_{assetName}        # Asset binary data
├── {assetId}_attribution.json              # Attribution metadata
└── blocked_assets.log                      # Blocked import log
```

### Attribution Metadata Format
```json
{
  "AssetId": "guid-here",
  "OwnerId": "owner-guid-here",
  "Name": "asset_name.ext",
  "ImportedAt": "2025-01-07T12:00:00Z",
  "WatermarkScan": {
    "HasWatermark": false,
    "DetectedWatermarks": [],
    "ScanDetails": "No watermarks detected",
    "ScannedAt": "2025-01-07T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "OwnershipVerification": {
    "IsVerified": true,
    "Status": "Custom",
    "VerificationMethod": "No Watermarks Detected",
    "Details": "Asset appears to be custom or original work",
    "VerifiedAt": "2025-01-07T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Watermark Detection Capabilities

### Metadata Detection
Scans for these metadata fields:
- copyright
- creator
- author
- owner
- license
- rights
- company

### Binary Data Detection
- JPEG EXIF markers
- Embedded copyright symbols (©, ™, ®)
- Copyright/trademark text in binary data

### Text Pattern Detection
Detects references to known brands/companies:
- Unity, Unreal Engine
- Adobe products
- Autodesk products
- Blender
- Epic Games
- Valve

## Integration Points

### With Federated Systems
The Asset Security Module should be integrated into any federated asset import pipeline:
1. Receive asset from federated source
2. Extract metadata and binary data
3. Create `AssetDefinition` object
4. Pass to `ImportAssetAsync()` with `requireOwnershipProof: true`
5. Handle import result (success or blocked)

### With Asset Registry
Can be combined with `IAssetRegistryModule` for full asset lifecycle management:
1. Asset Security verifies and imports asset
2. Asset Registry registers asset with blockchain/ledger
3. Both systems maintain ownership and transfer history

## Compliance & Legal

This module helps ensure compliance with:
- **Intellectual Property Rights**: Prevents unauthorized use of copyrighted/trademarked assets
- **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**: Provides technical measures to prevent infringement
- **Platform Liability Protection**: Demonstrates good-faith efforts to prevent IP violations
- **Terms of Service Enforcement**: Ensures users only import assets they own or have rights to use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **AI-Based Watermark Detection**: Machine learning models for steganographic watermark detection
2. **Blockchain Verification**: Integration with blockchain for ownership proof validation
3. **Third-Party API Integration**: Connect to stock image/3D model databases for automated verification
4. **Digital Rights Management (DRM)**: Support for DRM-protected assets
5. **Automated License Checking**: Parse and verify license agreements automatically
6. **Community Reporting**: Allow users to report unauthorized asset usage

## Troubleshooting

### Asset Import Blocked
**Issue**: Asset import is blocked even though you own the asset  
**Solution**: 
1. Check the watermark scan results to see what was detected
2. Provide proof of ownership or license documentation
3. Contact administrator to manually verify and approve the asset
4. Consider using `requireOwnershipProof: false` for trusted sources (use with caution)

### False Positive Watermark Detection
**Issue**: Custom asset is flagged as containing watermarks  
**Solution**:
1. Review the detected watermarks to understand what triggered the detection
2. Remove metadata fields that might contain third-party references
3. Ensure filenames don't contain brand names
4. Contact administrator for manual review if needed
