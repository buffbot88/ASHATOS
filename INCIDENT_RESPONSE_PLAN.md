## üéØ Purpose

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) establishes procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents affecting the RaOS platform. All team members with access to production systems must be familiar with this plan.

---

## üìã Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### P0 - Critical (Response: Immediate)
**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, or severe security vulnerability actively exploited

**Examples:**
- Unauthorized access to production database
- Active data exfiltration detected
- Complete system unavailability (>95% of users affected)
- Authentication bypass exploit in the wild
- Ransomware or destructive malware detected
- Critical zero-day vulnerability with active exploitation

**Response Time:** < 15 minutes  
**Escalation:** Immediate - Page on-call engineer and security team

#### P1 - High (Response: Within 1 hour)
**Impact:** Significant security vulnerability or unauthorized access with potential for data compromise

**Examples:**
- Unauthorized admin/SuperAdmin access attempt
- Suspicious activity indicating reconnaissance or probing
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting >50% of users
- Discovery of exposed credentials or API keys
- SQL injection attempt detected
- Session hijacking detected
- Critical vulnerability discovered (not yet exploited)

**Response Time:** < 1 hour  
**Escalation:** Notify on-call engineer and security team

#### P2 - Medium (Response: Within 4 hours)
**Impact:** Security misconfiguration or vulnerability with limited immediate impact

**Examples:**
- Failed login attempts exceeding threshold
- Minor information disclosure (non-sensitive data)
- Misconfigured CORS or security headers
- Outdated dependency with known vulnerability (no active exploit)
- Suspicious but not confirmed malicious activity
- Rate limiting triggered repeatedly

**Response Time:** < 4 hours  
**Escalation:** Notify security team during business hours

#### P3 - Low (Response: Within 24 hours)
**Impact:** Minor security concern or policy violation

**Examples:**
- Security scan findings (low risk)
- Minor policy violations
- Audit log anomalies requiring investigation
- User account lockout due to failed login attempts
- Low-risk vulnerability in non-production environment

**Response Time:** < 24 hours  
**Escalation:** Document and track in issue tracker

---

## üîç Detection & Triage (Phase 1)

### Detection Methods

1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Security event log alerts (Application Insights)
   - Failed login attempt thresholds (>10 in 5 minutes)
   - Rate limiting triggers
   - Error rate spikes (>10% above baseline)
   - Disk usage alerts (>85%)
   - Memory usage alerts (>90%)

2. **Security Scanning**
   - CodeQL automated scans
   - Dependency vulnerability scans
   - Secret scanning alerts
   - Weekly security audit workflow

3. **Manual Reporting**
   - User reports (support@agpstudios.online)
   - Team member observations
   - Bug bounty submissions (if program active)
   - Third-party security researcher disclosure

### Initial Triage Checklist

When an incident is detected, the first responder should:

- [ ] **Confirm the incident** - Verify it's not a false positive
- [ ] **Classify severity** - Assign P0/P1/P2/P3 level
- [ ] **Document initial findings** - Create incident ticket with:
  - Detection time and method
  - Affected systems/users
  - Initial indicators of compromise (IOCs)
  - Preliminary impact assessment
- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** - Based on severity level
- [ ] **Begin evidence preservation** - Don't destroy logs or artifacts

### Triage Timeline

| Severity | Initial Assessment | Classification | Notification |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| P0       | 5 minutes         | 10 minutes     | 15 minutes   |
| P1       | 15 minutes        | 30 minutes     | 60 minutes   |
| P2       | 1 hour            | 2 hours        | 4 hours      |
| P3       | 4 hours           | 8 hours        | 24 hours     |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Containment (Phase 2)

### Immediate Actions (P0/P1)

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Stop the application
   systemctl stop racore
   
   # Block suspicious IPs at firewall
   sudo ufw deny from <IP_ADDRESS>
   
   # Disable compromised user accounts
   # Via SuperAdmin Control Panel or direct database access
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Capture current logs before they rotate
   cp -r /var/log/racore/* /backup/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/
   
   # Capture memory dump if system compromise suspected
   # (Advanced - requires tools)
   
   # Export security events
   # Via API: GET /api/auth/events
   ```

3. **Revoke Access**
   - Invalidate all active sessions
   - Rotate API keys and tokens
   - Change admin credentials
   - Disable affected user accounts

4. **Communication**
   - Update incident ticket with containment actions
   - Notify affected users (if personal data compromised)
   - Prepare internal status updates

### Short-term Containment

**Goals:** Stop the immediate threat while planning long-term fixes

- Apply temporary patches or workarounds
- Enable additional monitoring
- Implement emergency rate limiting
- Enable maintenance mode if necessary
- Document all changes made

### Containment Decision Matrix

| Incident Type | Containment Action | Approval Required |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Unauthorized access | Disable account, invalidate sessions | On-call engineer |
| Data breach | Isolate affected systems, revoke keys | Security officer + CTO |
| DoS attack | Rate limit offending IPs, enable DDoS protection | On-call engineer |
| Malware | Isolate infected systems, run scans | Security officer |
| Vulnerability exploit | Apply patch, disable vulnerable feature | Technical lead |

## üî¨ Investigation & Analysis (Phase 3)

### Investigation Goals

1. **Determine Root Cause**
   - How did the incident occur?
   - What vulnerability or misconfiguration was exploited?
   - Was it external attack or internal error?

2. **Assess Impact**
   - What data was accessed/modified/stolen?
   - How many users affected?
   - What systems were compromised?
   - Duration of the incident

3. **Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
   - IP addresses
   - User accounts
   - File hashes
   - URLs or domains
   - Attack signatures

### Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Review security event logs
  ```bash
  # Check authentication logs
  grep -i "login_failed\|unauthorized" logs/security-*.log
  
  # Check for suspicious API calls
  grep -i "401\|403\|429" logs/racore-*.log
  ```

- [ ] Review application logs
  ```bash
  # Recent errors
  grep -i "error\|exception" logs/racore-*.log | tail -100
  
  # Suspicious patterns
  grep -E "(\.\./|%2e%2e|etc/passwd|/bin/sh)" logs/racore-*.log
  ```

- [ ] Review database access logs
  ```sql
  -- Check recent admin actions
  SELECT * FROM audit_log 
  WHERE action LIKE '%admin%' OR action LIKE '%superadmin%'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;
  
  -- Check for suspicious queries
  SELECT * FROM audit_log 
  WHERE details LIKE '%DELETE%' OR details LIKE '%DROP%'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
  ```

- [ ] Review network traffic (if available)
  - Unusual outbound connections
  - Large data transfers
  - Access from unusual geographic locations

- [ ] Review file system changes
  ```bash
  # Files modified in last 24 hours
  find /opt/racore -type f -mtime -1
  
  # Check for suspicious executables
  find /opt/racore -type f -executable
  ```

- [ ] Interview affected users (if applicable)
  - When did they first notice the issue?
  - What were they doing when incident occurred?
  - Any suspicious emails or communications?

### Evidence Collection

**Create incident evidence package:**
```bash
INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID

# Collect logs
cp -r logs/* /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/logs/

# Export database (if applicable)
sqlite3 Databases/racore.db .dump > /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/database-dump.sql

# Export security events
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:7077/api/auth/events \
  > /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/security-events.json

# Document system state
uname -a > /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/system-info.txt
ps aux >> /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/system-info.txt
netstat -tulpn >> /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/system-info.txt

# Create archive
tar -czf /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID.tar.gz /backup/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/
```
